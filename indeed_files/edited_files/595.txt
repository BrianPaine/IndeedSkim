				Requirements

				Us: an organization that really wants to shift to making data-driven decisions rather than leading with narrative.



You: a mid-level data analyst that is really excited by this prospect!



The Customer Experience team at Macmillan Learning is working very hard to shift from a narrative-lead story to a data-lead story and need a strong Data Analyst who is curious, flexible, and Customer-focused to help us make this important shift. Lots of people

 say they are data-driven, but we’re actually doing it – understanding that a story built with data at the center will surely meet the needs of our Customer. We are looking for someone who can help us to ask the right questions and data-dive to find the answers.

 The right person will be comfortable stepping out and trying a few different things before raising a flag and declaring victory, but who will be confident enough to lead the data analysis efforts for the team. We’re a Salesforce-leaning shop, so hopefully

 you’re comfortable working with Salesforce, Wave, and the data it produces. Check out the full job description and if this sounds like you then we look forward to talking to you about Macmillan being your new work family!



The Data Analyst works to develop and present opportunities to improve business practices by collecting, analyzing, and transforming data into useful and meaningful information that encourages more effective, strategic, and operational insight and collaborative

 decision-making. This role is also responsible for developing and maintaining a web-based delivery system for visibility and reporting data to stakeholders.



Required skills and experience:

• Strong communication skills, verbally, in writing, and presentation

• Demonstrated proficiency in technology

• Proven analytical and problem-solving skills

• Self-motivated

• Strong research skills

• Strong organization and time management skills

• Working knowledge of data structure and modeling

• Knowledge of or experience with MySQL 

• Experience with BI tools

• Experience with SIPOC analysis, process mapping, Lean, Six Sigma, or other related tools and methodologies



Super-awesome high-five if you also have:

• Experience with CRM systems, e.g. Salesforce

• Lean Six Sigma or similar certification

• Experience with Moodle and/or another LMS (Blackboard, Canvas, D2L, Sakai)

• Programming or prototyping experience, e.g. HTML, LaTeX, Javascript, PHP

• Experience with online homework systems
