    A time and a place to thrive
   -->

  
    
      Sterling-Rice Group (SRG) is a premier consulting and communications firm. We have created positive and enduring impact for our clients for more than 30 years.
      SRG’s unique fusion of strategic and creative capabilities has helped build brands and drive growth at companies big (e.g., PepsiCo, Wendy’s, Lilly) and small (e.g., Dave’s Killer Bread, MyChelle Dermaceuticals, Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers). Founded in 1984, we’ve grown our firm through an integrated combination of capabilities that, together, are unique in the industry. We specialize in consumer insights, strategy, innovation, design, and communications.
      Perhaps more important than what we do at SRG is how we do it. Before ever having a client, our founders defined the core beliefs upon which SRG would be built: Excellence, Creativity, Education, Honesty, Respect, Social Value, Responsibility, and Fun. For 30+ years, we have measured our performance on these beliefs annually. And because we live these beliefs every day, we’ve been named a Best Place to Work by AdAge in 2017 and Outside Magazine for the past six years.
      We are presently seeking candidates for the positions listed below.
