    Doing Great Things

    

        

            

                

                Building a brighter future

            

            In 2015, we saved $119 million in annualized energy – and that’s only the start of how we’re in the business of doing good.

        

        

            

                

                Making an impact

            

            We’re working to make a difference in our communities – like our $250 million commitment to education through AT&T Aspire. 

        

        

            

                

                Ensuring every voice matters

            

            With 115,000+ employees in our employee networks, we celebrate the amazing things our differences bring to the table.

                

    

    

        

            

                

                Putting military skills to work

            

            We’re on a mission to hire the best talent – a big mission. We’re committed to hiring 20,000 veterans by 2020.

        

        

            

                

                Developing what’s next

            

            Whether it’s in AT&T Labs, the AT&T Foundry or our Mobile App Hackathons, we’re unleashing talent and turning big ideas into big possibilities.

        

        

            

                

                Taking your career far

            

            With mentors to guide your way and lots of training opportunities, there’s no limit to how much you can grow or where your career can go.
