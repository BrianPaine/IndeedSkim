                            Pros 
Managers (at least mine) actually listened to and advocated for their employees. Great pay. Nice perks. Good culture -- people didn't seem miserable.
Cons 
As with any big company, can take a while for things to get done. Lots of layers, etc. But definitely moves faster than other big companies I've worked for.
Advice to Management 
Don't advance those mid- to senior mgrs who just go through the motions. Do more to keep smart, talented people on board.
